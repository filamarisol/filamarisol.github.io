## On Lisa Spiro's This Is Why We Fight: Defining the Values of the Digital Humanities.

In this post I would like to comment on the Lisa Spiro’s article “‘This Is Why We Fight’: Defining the Values of the Digital Humanities” in order to think in the possibilities of applying the set of values that she proposes for the Digital Humanities to the practice of academic history.

Spiro starts by questioning the idea of a sense of community among the Digital Humanities practitioners. She thinks that is necessary a discussion on the values that connect and hold in common the digital humanists. The question of the values comes after the acknowledgment of the interdisciplinary character of what can be thought as Digital Humanities, and the consequential impossibility of having a fixed definition of what it is, what are their methods and approaches. Rather than ontologically defining the digital humanities community, she looks to do it through the sets of practices and values that its practitioners have in common, in concordance with its goals. In her own words,

>“rather than debating who is in and who is out, the DH community needs to develop a keener sense of what it stands for and what is at stake in its work”.

Nevertheless, the definition of this set of values can also foreclose future understandings, methodologies and practices. In this sense, the flexible aspect of the proposed values statement needs to be, for Spiro, a sine qua non condition. She is not trying to propose ethical guidelines that the digital community needs to follow, but rather, a flexible and collaborative set of values that allows the space to “inspire and to help an organization set of priorities, defining what it holds most important”. At the same time, having this statement of values will help to frame - but not to settle - debates in the digital humanities  and to provide grounds for conversation.

One of the characteristics that this values statement needs to have is to be produced by its own community of practitioners, and not to come down on high from a “selected committee” of members. The production and discussion of these common values needs to be done in horizontal and collaborative spaces, that privilege openness, self-reflection, and that help the profession to mature. But, where to set the ground for opening the discussion of these values? For Spiro, “the values of the humanities provide the foundation for the digital humanities”. Nevertheless, the general values of the humanities often differ with the professional values of academic humanities. She finds that the latter focus more

>“on asserting the importance of scholarly authority and professional identity than on how scholars work and what they do for society”.

In this sense, the emphasis on professional authority and specialization is at odds with the collaborative, crowdsourced approaches that digital humanities stands for. So, to think and re-elaborate these values in the Internet age, in a networked age where “information is not a commodity to be controlled but a social good to be shared and reused” is the goal of her article. In her own words,

>“grounded in humanistic values but catalyzed by Internet values, the digital humanities seeks to push the humanities into new territory by promoting collaboration, openness, and experimentation”.

With an aim to open a conversation, Spiro proposes a list of values for the digital humanities community. To think about them, she draws mostly from manifestos, model statements of values and her own analysis of the rhetoric of the digital humanities. So, what are these proposed values? The first one is openness, as it “operates on several levels in the digital humanities, describing a commitment to the open exchange of ideas, the development, of open content and software, and transparency”. Openness is followed by collaboration, emphasizing in the creation and maintenance of collaborative spaces with an aim of building a new kind of communal behavior. The embrace of collaboration is and should be grounded in the intrinsic diversity of the digital humanities community. The third posed value is collegiality and connectedness. The promotion of contributions among the different members and the offer of help to those who need it, defines this value. Diversity is then affirmed, as it recognizes the digital humanities community multiply represented across disciplines. Lastly, experimentation is introduced, and its emphasis on “risk taking, entrepreneurship, and innovation”. In this sense,

>“for the digital humanities community, experimentation suggests not only a method of testing ideas and creating knowledge but also its engagement in transforming traditional approaches to teaching and research”.

As previously mentioned, the list of values that Spiro is offering operates as the starter of an open conversation that may help on crafting a more coherent identity for the Digital Humanities. As she says, “what defines a profession is not only what it does, but also what it upholds and how it practices ‘professional responsibility’”.Is it possible to think these values beyond the space of Digital Humanities as Spiro is urging and to extend them to a broader thought and reflection of the own practice of academics in the humanities? As she says, “to some extend, some digital humanities values may clash with the norms of the academy”. Do they? I think that sadly, the answer is a positive one. As mentioned earlier on this post, the professional values of academic humanities are still defined by specialization, scholarly authority and mostly, an individualistic approach to the object of study. The lack of collaborative spaces among the academic humanities is unfortunately, still predominant. Contributing to it are the universities’ intellectual property policies, and also the “humanities departments (that) favor solo work in their tenure and promotion policies”. Nevertheless, not only institutional policies are limiting the practice of historians, but also an ongoing emphasis on scholarly authority, that is skeptical to a more collaborative and inclusive work. Lamentably, in my own understanding of the state of the things, nowadays interdisciplinarity is only working on an individual level and foreclosing open and collaborative spaces that may enrich in several levels the academic practice.

## When Academics Go Digital


Last week we discussed if the values that the Digital Humanities community intends to embrace should be - or already are - applicable to academic history. Going through Spiro’s proposed set of values for the DH [“This Is Why We Fight”: Defining the Values of the Digital Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/13) - [On Lisa Spiro’s “This Is Why We Fight”: Defining the Values of the Digital Humanities.](https://filamarisol.github.io/Spiro_post), we found that many of them, specially those that focus on collaboration, interdisciplinarity,collegiablity and openness, to name just a few, are not reflecting current scholar’s academic practice in the humanities. We mentioned institutional limitations, but also a still persistent idea of the scholar’s authority and professional identity that operates in an opposite way than these values do. This week, the aim is precisely to discuss about **professional identity in the realms of the digital age**. Should scholars cultivate a digital identity through different social media, create their own websites and/or blogs? If so, to what extend? Moreover, do digital identities make possible the development of a public persona that may or may not be aligned with an off-line identity? The articles I’ll be commenting on this week reflect on some of these questions, and propose different answers to them.  

In [A Defense of Academic Twitter](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2016/10/19/how-academics-can-use-twitter-most-effectively-essay) Patrick Iber reflects on academics’ public engagement, and the anxieties that Twitter may provoke. Does Twitter serve for academic purposes? He says it does, and for several interesting reasons. First of all, it allows academics and people in other knowledge industries to interact directly. But also, it allows academics to interact with other people that share their research interests. So either to connect with people outside or within their fields, Twitter opens up the possibilities for sharing -and learning- knowledge. Twitter also allows scholars to share their work, readings, interests, to be known and to get to know.


[Katrina Gulliver](http://www.chronicle.com/article/10-Commandments-of-Twitter-for/131813/) also refers to the use of Twitter for academics, and she mentions several vantage points, such as connecting with scholars that you have never met before, receiving and sending copies of articles in a much more faster way than using a traditional interlibrary loan and building new networks through the creation of specific hashtags. But also, and this is interesting,

> “tweeting only when you’re engaged in worthy academic activity creates a sterile feed. It looks artificial, like you’re trying to present yourself as an academic robot”.

In a few words, “you are allowed on Twitter to admit to having a life outside of academe.” And this is cool, as we *do* and *should* have a life outside the academia.


So now, what about scholars having their own blog or website? In [Do You Need Your Own Website While On the Job Market?](http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/do-you-need-your-own-website-while-on-the-job-market/35825), Jentery Sayers says that although having professional-oriented websites such as Academia.edu, LinkedIN  or RSS, scholars - and graduate students preparing for the job market - can find a difference in creating - and maintaining! - their own websites. Having your personal website allows you to exhibit your work, to create a “portfolio for ‘middle-state publishing-, (…) ‘a web publication that exists between a blog and a journal’”. Moreover, your work can be discovered before, during, or after conferences, and it will not be tied to the interface of the professional-oriented sites that we mentioned before. Design matters, and as Sayers says “design is an argument”. Likewise,

> “a professional site can also offer your audiences opportunities to navigate through your materials in a non-linear fashion not easily afforded by print materials, PDFs, or DOCs.”.

And blogs? Do they serve to academic purposes? Chuck Tyron, in [Blogging, Scholarship, and the Networked Public Sphere] (http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/mla2009/tryon/mla2009draft), reflects on the public sphere, and the possibilities that scholars may have in engaging with it through blogging. New practices for scholarly communication allows scholarship to become increasingly networked. Additionally, the practice of blogging, of doing it regularly, allows to pose and propose provisional forms of knowledge, allows to raise questions and to experiment. It also asks for feedback and may generate new insights and alternative ways of approach. But most importantly, it allows and encourages multiple types of readers and responses, which can enrich and expand the scholars’ work. Moreover, as Tyron says,

> “provides the opportunity not only to benefit from the expertise of a wide range of readers–whether scholars or industry professionals–but also to build a well-developed, cross-referenced archive that can serve as a kind of history of the present.” 

[Christopher Long] (http://cplong.org/2013/09/the-googled-graduate-student/) also talks about blogs and the practice of graduate students. Does blogging help graduate students? It does, and in many ways. As he says,

> “first, the simple attempt to formulate your thoughts in words accessible to an imagined reader will help you give shape to your ideas. Writing for an audience, particularly one situated in a public sphere in which a real response is possible, requires a certain rigor. It compels you to put words to thoughts in ways that make them accessible and relevant to a wider community.”

I find that statement important, and totally true. Blogs can also operate as a “micro publishing platform” and it allows the graduate student to be known. By cultivating the habit of public academic writing, the student becomes more productive, and I also agree to that point. Finally, it helps building networks and to find new material more easily and quickly by connecting the student with other people from different places with common academic interests.

Finally, I would like to briefly comment on the article of Kim Barbour and David Marshall, [The Academic Online: Constructing Persona Through the World Wide Web](http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3969/3292). As the authors say,”persona creation is a much more conscious process in online settings as opposed to off-line”. There is an intentional strategy in the self-presentation in online settings,”because communicators must consciously *re* -present themselves online”. The authors analyze different types of constructed academic personas, and some of the characteristics that each of them assume. Although they trend to differentiate these constructions, I believe that many of these identities can also overlap and that you can in fact construct different digital identities depending on who you’re interacting to. For instance, the fact of myself interacting with my students through a specific platform designed for a particular course, doesn’t limit me to also create a different self, let’s say a networked one to connect with a different audience. In any case, the important point here is the relation between a professional off-line and online identity. As the authors say,

> “The academic persona, like other online persona, also has to connect authentically to an individual’s professional work. It is not hype or spin, but more an elaboration of what one is conceptualizing or thinking about, developing, and achieved. In the micro–publics of academia, the online persona will resemble other peer reviewed systems of knowledge production and be primarily judged on its merits.“

## The path for redemption


Reading through Lupton’s book has been both a learning and a condemn. It opened up an absolutely new world for me and this world has nothing to do with the one I used to habit in terms of typography and text design. It was impossible for me not to read every section of the book *Thinking with Type* and not to think about all the *type crimes* I’ve been systematically committing in my presentations, papers, flyers, blog posts, and every single writing I’ve done so far. Starting with what typeface to choose, how to combine caps, small caps, lowercases to the alignment of the text, the disposition of it in space and the different meanings it may carry…ended possibilities to be used with proper knowledge and wisdom. As Lupton says, the interesting thing about her book is that the emphasis on typography is an emphasis

>“on with - typography is a tool for doing things with: shaping content, >giving language a physical body, enabling the social flow of messages” (9).

Moreover, another aspect highlighted by the author is that from what typeface to choose to its size, all is a matter of context.

>“Scale is physical.People intuitively judge the size of objects in relation >to their own bodies and environments.

Changes in scale help create visual contrast, movement and depth, as well as express hierarchies of importance. And this is really important. I believe that it’s not only a matter of what you’re saying, but how you’re saying it. The Form complements and enriches your content. I’ve personally always thought in that way, and loved well designed sites and blogs, but when it was my own work, I wasn’t able to replicate all the things I liked from others.

Moving from the letter to the text, I found super interesting the different meanings you can create simply by particular arrangement of the letters in space. In a few words, saying less by showing differently.
Another aspect of the text to be mindful of are paragraphs. And there again, when reading to all the *do not* practices for having a paragraph properly display on the web, I felt ashamed of all the overused I’ve been doing so far.

All right. I’ve been committing so many *type crimes*. But, should I have known how to do it right? Or under a better design? Maybe I could have looked for myself some guides for graphic design, I should have talked to some friends for best practices and tips, I could have also be more mindful between the relation of the content and the form. I definitely could and should have done all of that. And we, as students, graduate or undergraduate, could receive some training on that. We’re in a way pushed to work in multiple environments, and the digital is becoming a key one. Because of that, design should be part of our training, as it would enrich our scholarship. Again, for me the form complements and enhance the content. Putting a deliberate effort in design, in thinking both what and how we’re saying things, is a practice that can only add value to our work. Although not explicitly, our readers will appreciate it. It may take time, learning, practice and working with many unknown concepts and tools, but I think that it’s worth it.
