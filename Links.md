## Links


Below is a list of assembled links to websites with relevant historical materials or more contemporary cultural productions related to my research interests. I will try to also include brief descriptions of what you might find there.

The audio-blog Afrolis is a space in which Afrodescendants living in Lisbon share their experiences and cultural productions.
