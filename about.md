This is me when *I go virtual*.

And here is something more about me in terms of academic interests:

Iâ€™m a second year PhD student in the Romance Languages and Literatures Spanish department, at the University of Michigan. I was trained as an Historian in the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina), where I pursued my undergraduate studies.  My research interests include African migrantsâ€™ contemporary literature, cinema and alternative artistic expressions through digital platforms, with special emphasis on Lusophone African diaspora in Portugal and Brazil. More specifically, my work examines the reconstruction of immigrantsâ€™ individual and collective identities in the new country and their representations across different cultural productions.

**There's more coming soon...** ðŸŽˆ
