Hi everybody! This site is part of the Winter 2017 [Digital History course](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-methods/schedule.html) from the [History Department](https://lsa.umich.edu/history) at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/).

I will be posting **weekly responses** to the readings we do and the digital tools and techniques we experiment with. You can find them [here](/698-Portfolio/).

You can also know a bit more **about** me if you click [here](/about/) or even more if you browse my [CV](/cv/)

I also wanted to include some **links** of different sites that I thought very useful in terms of my academic interests, as well as some resources. You can find them [here](/links/)! Hope you find them interesting, too!

**Comments, suggestions, ideas, critiques**, all of them are more than welcome and **truly appreciated**! This is a **work in progress** and I hope to improve the site and its contents as long as I am learning and getting familiar with the DH world. So if you feel it, you can <a href="mailto:mafila@umich.edu">email me!</a>
