## Blogposts


Hi all! I'll be posting here weekly responses from the readings we are doing and the digital tools and techniques that we are exploring in the [Digital History course](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-methods/schedule.html) from the [History Department](https://lsa.umich.edu/history) at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/).

You can consider these posts as a work in progress, I am writing them as long as I am learning and reflecting about the DH world, its **possibilities and shortcomings**, but specially, while thinking  about its **potentialities**.

Comments, suggestions and ideas are very welcome and truly appreciated! You can find my contact info [here](/cv/).
