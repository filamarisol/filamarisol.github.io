This is me when *I go virtual*.

And here is something more about me in terms of my **academic life**:

I’m a second year PhD student in the [Romance Languages and Literatures](https://lsa.umich.edu/rll) Spanish department, at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/). I was trained as an Historian in the [University of Buenos Aires](http://www.uba.ar/), Argentina, where I pursued my undergraduate studies.  My research interests include African migrants’ contemporary literature, cinema and alternative artistic expressions through digital platforms, with special emphasis on Lusophone African diaspora in Portugal and Brazil. More specifically, my work examines the reconstruction of immigrants’ individual and collective identities in the new country and their representations across different cultural productions.
